# Iot_based_mining_Helmet

<p>The smart miner helmet utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technology, enabling seamless communication and data exchange among the various sensors and the central monitoring system. A cloud-based application handles all the monitoring and alert system tasks, allowing for real-time monitoring of environmental conditions, miner location tracking, and immediate detection of potential hazards. The alert system is a two-way system, wherein the monitoring team can trigger timely warnings through the app, and miners can also alert the ground team through the button fitted on their helmet if they encounter any danger. This ensures that miners are promptly alerted to any danger and can take necessary actions to protect themselves, with the help of the alert system.

The implementation of the IoT-based mining helmet has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry by significantly reducing the incidence of occupational accidents and fatalities. The integration of advanced sensors and alert systems provides miners with crucial information and warnings in real time, allowing them to make informed decisions and take appropriate measures to ensure their safety. This report will delve into the various components used in the smart miner helmet, their functionalities, and the benefits they offer in enhancing miner safety in the mining industry.
